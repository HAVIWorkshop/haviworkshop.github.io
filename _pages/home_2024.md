        <h3>Safer Autonomous Systems with Predictive Intelligence & Generative Simulation</h3><br />
        <b>Abstract</b>
        <p class="speaker-abstract"> Safety in autonomous driving relies on accurately predicting the motion of surrounding agents and generating realistic driving environments for robust simulation and testing. In this talk, I present two advancements that enhance these capabilities. First, I introduce RealMotion, a motion forecasting framework designed for continuous driving. Unlike traditional models that process scenes independently, RealMotion captures evolving situational and contextual relationships across time, improving forecasting accuracy and real-world efficiency for safer decision-making.
Next, I explore DriveX, a driving scene synthesis approach that enables free-form trajectory simulation. While existing methods struggle with novel trajectories due to limited video perspectives, DriveX leverages video generative priors to optimize a 3D scene model across diverse paths, allowing for scalable, high-fidelity simulations that support safer and more adaptable autonomous systems. By bridging predictive intelligence with generative simulation, this talk highlights new pathways toward safer, more reliable autonomous driving. </p>

  <span class="authors">Yuto Kumamoto, Kento Ohtani, Daiki Suzuki, Minori Yamataka, Kazuya Takeda</span>
  <!-- <span class="authors"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Traffic accident anticipation is an important issue for reducing the number of road fatalities and for realizing safe autonomous driving. Conventional models for accident anticipation primarily rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and have achieved notable success. In contrast, transformers have recently achieved significant success in various fields, including video processing. However, their performance in accident anticipation remains below that of RNN-based models. In this study, we propose the Accident Anticipation Transformer with Driver Attention (AAT-DA), a novel model that leverages transformers for both temporal and spatial feature extraction. The model also leverages driver attention to focus on objects likely to be involved in an accident. Additionally, the model can specify an object that moves dangerously through the attention matrix. The model recorded the state-of-the-art anticipation performance on two representative datasets for accident anticipation.</span> -->

  <span class="title"><strong>Snapshot: Towards Application-centered Models for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction in Urban Traffic Environments.</strong></span>
  <span class="authors">Nico Uhlemann, Yipeng Zhou, Tobias Mohr, Markus Lienkamp</span>
  <!-- <span class="authors"><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper explores pedestrian trajectory prediction in urban traffic while focusing on both model accuracy and real-world applicability. While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8 % while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</span> -->
 
  <span class="title"><strong>“What's Happening”- A Human-centered Multimodal Interpreter Explaining the Actions of Autonomous Vehicles.</strong></span>
  <span class="authors">Xuewen Luo, Fan Ding, Rishikesh Panda, Ruiqi  Chen, Junn Yong Loo; Shuyun Zhang</span>
    <!-- <span class="authors"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Public distrust of self-driving cars is growing. Studies emphasize the need for interpreting the behavior of these vehicles to passengers to promote trust in autonomous systems. Interpreters can enhance trust by improving transparency and reducing perceived risk. However, current solutions often lack a human-centric approach to integrating multimodal interpretations. This paper introduces a novel Human-centered Multimodal Interpreter (HMI) system that leverages human preferences to provide visual, textual, and auditory feedback. The system combines a visual interface with Bird’s Eye View (BEV), map, and text display, along with voice interaction using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). Our user study, involving diverse participants, demonstrated that the HMI system significantly boosts passenger trust in AVs, increasing average trust levels by over 8\%, with trust in ordinary environments rising by up to 30\%. These results underscore the potential of the HMI system to improve the acceptance and reliability of autonomous vehicles by providing clear, real-time, and context-sensitive explanations of vehicle actions.</span> -->
 
  <span class="title"><strong>Deep Learning-based rPPG Models towards Automotive Applications: A Benchmark Study.</strong></span>
  <span class="authors">Tayssir Bouraffa, Dimitrios Koutsakis, Salvija Zelvyte</span>
    <!-- <span class="authors"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has the potential to significantly enhance driver safety systems by enabling the detection of critical conditions, such as driver drowsiness and sudden illness, through non-invasive monitoring of cardio-respiratory functions. However, the dynamic environment within a vehicle, characterized by motion artifacts and varying illumination, presents unique challenges for accurate rPPG estimation. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of various supervised and unsupervised rPPG algorithms using the MR NIRP car dataset to assess their performance in automotive settings. Qualitative and quantitative experiments were performed to evaluate and compare several rPPG models designed in stable, noise-controlled environments, highlighting the impact of real-world conditions on model performance. Our findings highlight the promise of machine learning approaches, particularly neural network-based models, in overcoming these challenges and accurately estimating heart and respiration rates in real-world driving scenarios. This study underscores the potential for integrating rPPG-based monitoring systems into vehicles to enhance driver safety and well-being.</span>
